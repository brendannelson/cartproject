                <p>To make Downtown Fresno an overall better place to both live and establish a business, we have thought of a way to achieve this. By combining each of our unique ideas to improve Fresno as a whole, we believe we can change the way Downtown Fresno is percieved. Our multifaceted plan of action begins with bringing in a well-developed company to take roots in Downtown Fresno, which will attract new customers to our new location. When you think of a company such as Google, you don't see them establishing a location in a broken-down building, no, you seem them building their own multi-million dollar campus. The next aspect of our plan is to rebuild the Fulton Road which cut throught right where the Fulton Mall is now. By reestablishing the road, we could see increased foot traffic and more potential customers coming to our stores. The final facet of our plan is to freshen up how some of the buildings downtown look. By doing this, not only would more modern companies be compelled to build locations here, but our city would both look and feel much more clean.</p>
